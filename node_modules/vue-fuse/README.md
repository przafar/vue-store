# vue-fuse [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vue-fuse.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/vue-fuse)

> A Vue.js pluggin for fuzzy search library, Fuse.js
> There are two ways to use this plugin. The `vue-fuse` component, or the `$search` method. Be sure to take a look at the documentation for both below.

## Install
```bash
npm install vue-fuse
```
```bash
yarn add vue-fuse
```
In main.js
```js
import VueFuse from 'vue-fuse'

Vue.use(VueFuse)
```
## Full Fuse.js Documentation
This is just a simple drop in component leverage Fuse.js. For complete documentation, check out [http://fusejs.io/](http://fusejs.io/)

## $search Method
The `$search` instance method allows you to execute a search programmatically within your application. Calling the `this.$search` function will return a promise, that is fulfilled once Fuse.js returns completes the search. `$search` takes the following params:

* `term` - (required) the search term or query that you will search by
* `list` - (required) an array of items to search
* `options` - (required) an object with fuse.js options. At minimum, you must provide an array of `keys`. Other options will default to the fuse.js defaults (see here: http://fusejs.io/)

### $search example
```vue
this.$search(this.term, this.bikes, this.options).then(results => {
  this.searchResults = results
})
```

## vue-fuse Component
The `vue-fuse` component can be added any of your existing Vue components. It creates an `input` html element, and takes props (listed below) to execute a search. Search results are then returned via events.

### Compoment Props
Most of the props line up with Fuse.js `options` with the defaults set to match the defaut Fuse.js behavior.

    <td>Boolean</td>
    <td>false</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>includeScore</td>

    <td>Boolean</td>
    <td>false</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>includeMatches</td>
    <td>Whether the matches should be included in the result set. When true, each record in the result set will include the indices of the matched characters: indices: [start, end]. These can consequently be used for highlighting purposes.</td>
    <td>Boolean</td>
    <td>false</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>minMatchCharLength</td>
    <td>When set to include matches, only the matches whose length exceeds this value will be returned. (For instance, if you want to ignore single character index returns, set to 2)</td>

    <td>shouldSort</td>
    <td>Whether to sort the result list, by score.</td>
    <td>Boolean</td>
    <td>true</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>tokenize</td>
    <td>When true, the algorithm will search individual words and the full string, computing the final score as a function of both. In this case, the threshold, distance, and location are inconsequential for individual tokens, and are thus ignored.</td>
    <td>Boolean</td>

    <td>tokenSeparator</td>
    <td>Regex used to separate words when searching. Only applicable when `tokenize` is `true`.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>id</td>
    <td>The name of the identifier property. If specified, the returned result will be a list of the items' identifiers, otherwise it will be a list of the items.</td>
    <td>String</td>

    <td>location</td>
    <td>Determines approximately where in the text is the pattern expected to be found.</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>0</td>

  <tr>
    <td>threshold</td>
    <td>At what point does the match algorithm give up. A threshold of 0.0 requires a perfect match (of both letters and location), a threshold of 1.0 would match anything.</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>0.6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>distance</td>
    <td>Determines how close the match must be to the fuzzy location (specified by location). An exact letter match which is distance characters away from the fuzzy location would score as a complete mismatch. A distance of 0 requires the match be at the exact location specified, a distance of 1000 would require a perfect match to be within 800 characters of the location to be found using a threshold of 0.8.</td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>maxPatternLength</td>
    <td>The maximum length of the pattern. The longer the pattern (i.e. the search query), the more intensive the search operation will be. Whenever the pattern exceeds the maxPatternLength, an error will be thrown. </td>
    <td>Number</td>
    <td>32</td>

### Accessing Results from vue-fuse Component
Results are stored in the `result` data array of the `vue-fuse` component. The component `watch`es the `result` array and emits an event when the array is changed. This event is named `fuseResultsUpdated` and contains the result array. You can also name the event yourself (this is handy if you have more than one instance of `vue-fuse` in your application) by passing in a string to the `eventName` prop.
